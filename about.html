        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h3>MISSION</h3>
        <p>Fight Club offers a radical and gruelling practice of strength for men of all identities all across the US. Members of the club convene weekly where they participate in one-on-one fights with each other. Our intention is to improve the self-image, confidence, and mentality of our members. The club is a space for all participants to push themselves past their anticipated limits, allowing them to realize their true power. Not only is this an exercise of physical strength, but it translates into mental toughness, as well. Testimony to this can be read here.</p>
        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <p>Fight Club first began in 1999 as a secret collective of very few members including Founder, Tyler Durden. Club meetings were hosted in the basement of a small bar in Los Angeles, CA called Lou’s Tavern. The club has since evolved into a widespread movement with 20 thriving chapters across the country at the moment. Now, each chapter convenes in the basement of its local allowing bar, continuing the legacy that was born beneath Lou’s Tavern years ago. </p>
